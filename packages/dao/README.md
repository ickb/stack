# Lumos Utils

## TLDR: don't use it for now

In the last few months I gained a lot of experience with Lumos and I noticed that:

- there is a lot of overlap in the typescript code in my various projects/issues, which is still OK.
- every time I write a new one, I improve some parts of the boilerplate code, so then I have to manually modify all other copies, which definitely is **not OK**.

That's why I'm gonna turn that boilerplate code in this extensible small library.

PS: it's likely gonna change a lot and of course it's not documented, so for now I would advise anybody else against using it.
