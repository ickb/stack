# iCKB/Bot

Currently the Bot tries to minimize the amount of iCKB holdings, actively looking to convert them to CKB. This is to maximize the CKB liquidity that the bot can offer in case of a iCKB to CKB liquidity crunch, such as [when the redemptions overcome the short term availability of mature deposits](https://talk.nervos.org/t/dis-ickb-dckb-rescuer-funding-proposal-non-coding-expenses/8369/14).

**Rules of thumb**:

- Distribute liquidity across multiple isolated bots (each holding only a fraction) to keep potential hack losses manageable.
- Each bot liquidity must be at least 130k CKB.

## Docs

The docs directory aims to host comprehensive documentation outlining the inner workings of the iCKB Fulfillment Bot. As a living document, it will be continuously updated to reflect the Botâ€™s evolution and ongoing improvements:

- [iCKB Deposit Pool Rebalancing Algorithm](pool_rebalancing.md)
- [iCKB Deposit Pool Snapshot Encoding](pool_snapshot.md)
