# Feedback on the DApp

> Some other small things would be beneficial in addition to more explanation text, such as a link to the explorer once a transaction is submitted. [Jordan]

Yup, to do

> I think it'd be good if there some info about what ickb is, and have some sort of a wireframe for the landing page. you know like we should have blurb saying ickb is funded by the foundation with foundation logo etc and so on [Ahrom]

Halfway done, not sure about the foundation logo on the homepage.

> You will always get less ickb than what you exchanged. Thatâ€™s because the lifetime earnings of the dao are baked into the ickb you receive correct? Looks like around 13%. [Sean]

Yup, to do

This is tricky to get right as the full explanation is long and involved. Maybe it would help showing:

- The exchange ratio (as all converters do)
- A tooltip with a short explanation
- Within the short explanation, a link to the complete one.

> Is there a wait to exchange ickb back to CKB? [Sean]

Yup, to do
