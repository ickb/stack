/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 *
 * Entry-point script that samples block headers from a CKB mainnet public client
 * and prints a CSV report (BlockNumber, Date, Value, Note).
 *
 * Summary of behavior:
 * - Constructs a `ccc.ClientPublicMainnet` client and queries the genesis and tip headers.
 * - Builds a set of Date samples between genesis and tip (including a small set of
 *   named dates such as "Genesis", "iCKB Launch", and the "Tip").
 * - For each sample date, performs a binary search over block numbers to find
 *   the first block whose timestamp is greater than or equal to the sample date.
 * - Logs CSV lines with block number, ISO timestamp, converted value, and an optional note.
 *
 * Remarks:
 * - The sampling functions accept timestamps as bigint millisecond values.
 * - This file runs in Node.js (uses top-level await) and exits on completion or error.
 * - Failures in fetching blocks will throw.
 *
 * Example output (CSV):
 * BlockNumber, Date, Value, Note
 * 0, 2019-11-15T21:09:50.812Z, 1.00082, Genesis

/**
 * Main program that orchestrates sampling and logging.
 *
 * - Constructs a public mainnet client.
 * - Fetches genesis and tip headers (throws if missing).
 * - Computes an upper bound `n` for the block-number binary search using the
 *   bit-length of tip.number (a simple power-of-two bound).
 * - Generates date samples (per-year, `n` samples per year) and inserts a
 *   named "iCKB Launch" sample.
 * - For each date sample, finds the earliest block whose timestamp >= sample
 *   date via `asyncBinarySearch` and logs a CSV row for that header.
 *
 * Notes on error handling:
 * - Missing blocks will cause this function to throw.
 *
 * @returns Promise<void> that resolves when sampling and logging complete.
